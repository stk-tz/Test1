## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Load libraries
library(dplyr)

# Read in the CSV
data <- read.csv("Filtered_GDP_and_CO__Emissions_Data.csv")

# Filter for one country (e.g., New Zealand)
nz_data <- data %>%
  filter(Entity == "New Zealand") %>%
  select(Year, GDP, CO2_Production) %>%
  na.omit()

# Create GDP squared
nz_data$GDP_Squared <- nz_data$GDP^2

# Run the quadratic model
model <- lm(CO2_Production ~ GDP + GDP_Squared, data = nz_data)

# Summary of the model
summary(model)

# Plot GDP vs CO2 with regression curve
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(nz_data, aes(x = GDP, y = CO2_Production)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x + I(x^2), se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  ggtitle("Environmental Kuznets Curve - New Zealand") +
  xlab("GDP (PPP, constant 2021 $)") +
  ylab("CO2 Emissions (Production-based)")

# With print() â€“ this will output the model summary in the Console
print(summary(model))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
